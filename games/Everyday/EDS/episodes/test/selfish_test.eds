REM --- Emergencies need to be able to accept EVERY player into them. If the task is a non-ALL or OPEN task
REM --- You need to set an ObserverBehavior. This tells the game that this task can accept players into it
REM --- beyond the ones allowed by the cast/mechanic participation type. It also defines what those players
REM --- will SEE. We call this OBSERVER_BEHAVIOR_ID.

REM --- Note here that this emergency task has CAN_LEAVE set to FALSE, and gives an Observer Behavior ID of EMERGENCY
